Checkoff Question 1: The hit rate will stay 0.0 because step size is 32 bytes, which exactly is the entire cache size. So there is always a compulsory miss when accessing the requested data
Checkoff Question 2: step size can be 0 or 1 to increase the hit rate
Checkoff Question 3: 1. Such repeating hit/miss pattern results from that block size can accommodate 4 integers, out of which 2 are of our interest. Also, cache size and array size are the same so no Overriding block content. So for every block there is one miss (read miss, 4 consecutive integers are loaded onto cache) and 3 hits (write, hit, write). 2. Since shorted repeated pattern inclued 1 miss and 3 hits, the hit rate is 0.75.
Checkoff Question 4: Because the cache size is as large as the array size, there is no overriding the content of blocks.
Checkoff Question 5: Fill in the array elements chunk-wise (by chunk I mean a number of elements that can fit in the small cache exactly), then apply all functions on them. With one chunk done, repeat by filling the next chunk of elements.
Checkoff Question 6: Because the data once loaded into L2 cache remain unchanged after an inner loop
