Exercise 1 Checkoff Questions:
    1. Once given the virtual address, it's splitted into two fields: virtual page number and offset. With virtual page number obtained, the TLB is searched for it, which on the very first access would result in a TLB miss, thus going on searching page table, which would result in a page fault since nothing has been placed there before. The physical memory is then searched to find an appropriate space to place a page (to be brought from the disk), which generates a physical page number. Combining the physical page number and the offset obtained before we get a physical address to map the virtual address to.
    2. Because physical memory has 4 pages, which needs 2 bits to locate one, and virtual memory has 8 pages, which needs 3 bits to locate one.

Exercise 4 Checkoff Question:
    1. Because we are constantly switching between multiple processes and each of the switches would eliminate all the page table and TLB contents of the last process.
